# django-eelco
This is/will be the CMS for my websites. 
While I will do my best to keep it as generic as possible, there will be plenty of Eelco-isms to go around.

This is a learning experience for me both on Django level and on Python level, and I expect many of my approaches to be naive, feel free to point out what could be done better.
